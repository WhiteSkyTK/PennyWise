captures/
.externalNativeBuild/
.cxx/ # For NDK builds

# Local configuration files (should not be shared)
local.properties

# It's often better to ignore the whole .idea directory,
# unless you specifically want to share code style settings.
# For example:
# .idea/
# !.idea/codeStyles/ # Keep code styles if your team shares them

# Keystore files - VERY IMPORTANT TO IGNORE
*.jks
release-keystore.jks
# You can also be more specific if the keystore is in a subfolder, e.g., app/*.jks

# Usually handled within build/

# Custom files you might want to ignore
# For example, if you have specific test output files or temporary scripts
# temp/
# *.tmp

# If you added .ssb for a specific reason, keep it.
# Otherwise, if it's unknown, you might not need it.
# *.ssb

# If you have specific signing configurations for different environments in separate files
